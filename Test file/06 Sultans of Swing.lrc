[0:00.000] 
[0:13.780] You get a shiver in the dark,
[0:15.590] It's raining in the park. But meantime,
[0:18.380] 
[0:20.810] South of the river you stop and you hold everything.
[0:24.300] 
[0:28.040] A band is blowin' Dixie double-four time.
[0:31.010] 
[0:33.690] You feel alright when you hear that music ring.
[0:37.110] 
[0:42.720] Well now, you step inside but you don't see too many faces.
[0:47.390] 
[0:49.920] Comin' in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down.
[0:53.600] 
[0:57.140] Competition in other places,
[1:00.070] 
[1:03.550] Uh, but the horns they blowin' that sound.
[1:06.480] 
[1:09.900] Way on down south,
[1:11.390] 
[1:13.190] Way on down south, London-town.
[1:16.800] 
[1:27.810] You check out Guitar George,
[1:29.930] 
[1:30.850] He knows all the chords.
[1:33.200] 
[1:34.960] Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing.
[1:39.070] 
[1:41.940] They said an old guitar is all he can afford,
[1:46.670] 
[1:48.210] When he gets up under the lights to play his thing.
[1:51.460] 
[1:57.980] And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene.
[2:02.780] 
[2:04.140] He's got a daytime job he's doing alright.
[2:07.620] 
[2:10.990] He can play the honky tonk like anything.
[2:14.290] 
[2:17.580] Savin' it up for Friday night.
[2:20.320] 
[2:24.300] With the Sultans,
[2:25.600] 
[2:27.590] With the Sultans of Swing.
[2:30.450] 
[2:42.210] And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner.
[2:46.570] 
[2:49.430] Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles.
[2:53.600] 
[2:56.210] They don't give a damn about any trumpet playing band.
[3:01.070] 
[3:02.680] It ain't what they call Rock and Roll.
[3:05.670] 
[3:09.460] And the Sultans,
[3:10.770] 
[3:12.810] Yeah, the Sultans played Creole.
[3:15.760] 
[3:19.180] Creole, baby.
[3:20.070] 
[4:13.570] And the man he steps right up to the microphone.
[4:17.160] 
[4:20.330] And says at last, just as the time bell rings,
[4:23.510] 
[4:26.930] "Goodnight!"
[4:28.020] 
[4:28.690] "Now it's time to go home."
[4:31.530] 
[4:33.210] And he makes it fast with one more thing.
[4:36.140] 
[4:39.990] "We are the Sultans,"
[4:41.550] 
[4:43.170] "We are the Sultans of Swing."
[4:46.590]
